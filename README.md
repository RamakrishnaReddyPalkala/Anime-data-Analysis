📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights

Ratings Distribution: Most anime are rated between 6–8, showing viewer bias towards positive reviews.

Popularity Distribution: A few anime dominate global popularity, while most remain niche.

Genres: Action, Comedy, and Adventure are the most frequent genres.

Studios: A handful of studios (e.g., Toei Animation, Madhouse, Sunrise) dominate the industry.

Episodes vs Ratings: No strong correlation, but extremely long-running shows tend to have slightly lower ratings.

Correlation Analysis: Popularity and ratings show weak correlation → hype ≠ quality.

📌 Key Insights

User ratings are mostly positive – very few anime are rated poorly.



Popularity does not equal quality – hidden gems exist that are highly rated but not widely known.

TV anime dominate – typically 12–26 episodes per season.

Genre trends – mainstream genres like Action and Comedy dominate, but niche genres exist for targeted audiences.

Production concentration – a few studios produce the majority of influential anime.

🚀 Real-World Applications
